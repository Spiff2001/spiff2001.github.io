## hi!

this website is veeeery messy, but rn I can't really change that much of it, so bare with the next few lines: [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Spiff2001/spiff2001.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

##content!

```markdown

I really should think of stuff to put here.
